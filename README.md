## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned much more about the span element with this challenge. I also became more comfortable with Flexbox.

### Continued development

With every challenge I find that I still don't know as much fundamental HTML and CSS as I'd like. So I'll keep reading up on the basics.
